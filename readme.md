## PHP-Based RESTful services for a Student Progress Monitoring System ##

I started this as a fourth year student in University but having learned quite a bit since then would like to write it from scratch.

I'm using this project as a basis of reaffriming the skills I pick up from the day to day work but also to explore new technologies and plan to swap out the PHP backend for one built on NodeJS and possibly MongoDB.

Currently I'm starting with a PHP and MySQL backend, using the [Slim framework](http://www.slimframework.com/).

## Setting Up ##

1. Create a MySQL database name "directory".
2. Import student.sql, this will give you the initial student table with some sample data.
3. You can then test out the REST api by hitting <SERVER>/<PROJECT ROOT>/index.php/students/

If anyone is interested in getting involved in this project or has any questions don't hesitate to ask.
